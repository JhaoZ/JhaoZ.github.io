I started this blog on March 22nd, 2025. A backdated post is essentially a post that I had in mind in an earlier time before I made the blog. However, I still want to post them on this site. To keep my posts in order, I want to have them be in the order that I published them--although this means that they are not going to be technically in chronological order in terms of actual time. 

A common backdate post would be any image / gallery post I make. This is because I want to post my images here, especially ones I took before I started this website. Therefore, even if the published date of a backdated post is further ahead of some posts, the backdated post may be older than those posts, or even older than the blog. 

I chose this method because it would be very confusing for my "first blog post" to be after a bunch of other posts.
