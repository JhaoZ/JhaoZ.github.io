Hi there! This is the first post on my personal website / blog. 

I previously had a personal portfolio website, but I never liked the look of it and it was hard for me to update and add information because I  wrote the whole thing in pure HTML and CSS. 2 years later after I made the intial website, I decided I was going to remake it during spring break, and this is the result! 

This time, I didn't make the mistake of hard-coding everything in HTML, and decided I should start with a template. I've seen many people use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), so I gave it a try, and I really like the result! (Also cause I really suck at frontend so this is truly the best way for me to get something *presentable* on the internet). Although the original template was well-designed, I wanted to add some of my own flavor. When it comes to frontend, I have to say GPT is my good friend. After a combination of reading documentation and GPT, I was able to customize this website to my liking and style.
# Why a blog?
I have sometimes thought about maintaining a blog, but I never really wanted to code the whole thing out (like I said, I really suck at frontend). Since [this Hugo theme](https://github.com/athul/archie) makes posting very easy (it's all in markdown), I think its finally time for me to try running my own blog.

My issue when it came to having my own blog is that I honestly can't really think of anything I could post on here that would be "interesting" or "thought-provoking," but I realize thats not really the point either. Although I may not be a computer architecture wizard that can write captivating articles on optimizing low-latency code or a machine learning expert that can explain how deepseek's use of reinforcement learning is so ground-breaking, I think this blog can serve as a good place for me to jot some of my experiences down.

I think the ultimate goal is that this blog should be for me. I should be able to build something or experience something cool and write it here, sort of like storing digital momentos. Even if no one reads this blog, thats fine with me because I can eventually look back when I'm older and see how much growth I've experienced, either as a person or a developer. I also want to get better at technical writing, so I hope to be able to practice here. In addition, writing out my thought process for some of my projects or insights on something I learned can be pretty useful to me--I can read those posts again as a refresher (like having informal documentation).

One last reason why I want to maintain this blog is because I enjoy photography. I sometimes post my photos on social media, but they often compress my photos or have awful aspect ratio guidelines. Not a big fan of that. Although I am by no means a professional, I at least want a place where I can showcase some of my photos in a form I want. Photos are often also attached to memories, and I like the parallel that storing images here is kinda like storing memories here. In the future, I would like to be able add some posts about my other hobbies here too!

That's all I really wanted to say for now. Feel free to take a look around my website!

(And if you are a technical recruiter, I am always open to opportunities :D )
