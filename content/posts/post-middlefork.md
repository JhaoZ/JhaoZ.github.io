I made this post originally to try out a gallery feature I was implementing for this website. Coincidentally, I started working on right after I came back from the [Middle Fork River Forest Preserve](https://www.champaignforests.org/forest-preserve/champaign-county/middle-fork-river). For some context, Middle Fork is a sectioned out zone in the middle of Illinois (it literally is surrounded on all 4 sides by farm land) that serves as a nature preserve. It also is Illinois' only international dark sky park as of 2025. I've wanted to come for a while to take pictures of the stars or milky way, but I never really found the time. Now, on the last few days of spring break, I decided it was worth a trip. 

Like I mentioned, my original intention was to ensure my gallery feature was working. I can now safely say (sort of) that this feature works as intended. Here is a gallery of images I took while I was at Middle Fork: 

{{< gallery
  "images/middlefork/middlefork_1.jpg::Middle Fork lake at twilight"
  "images/middlefork/middlefork_2.jpg::Stars"
  "images/middlefork/middlefork_3.jpg::Long exposure shot of the lake with stars"
  "images/middlefork/middlefork_4.jpg::Lakeside"
  "images/middlefork/middlefork_6.jpg::Close to twilight"
  "images/middlefork/middlefork_7.jpg::Reflective trees"
  "images/middlefork/middlefork_8.jpg::More stars"
>}}

(Just a note, you can *even* click on the images to see them better or for their caption. Or you could just hover over one to see it's caption, if it has one.)

Here, I want to test out a non-gallery image that can also open up a pop up. Here is one I like (even though its blurry cause I couldn't hold my camera still enough for the 8 second exposure):

{{< lightimg src="images/middlefork/middlefork_5.jpg" alt="Long exposure" caption="Long exposure shot of the lake at Middle Fork" >}}

I have more photos on my actual camera. All of the photos above were taken with a Samsung S24+. When I have time (or if I remember), I'll upload some of the photos from my camera to here.
