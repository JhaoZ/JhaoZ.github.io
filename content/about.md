## Tl;dr: 

- I'm Bill Zhang, a Master's of CS students at UIUC 
- Interested in low level & (scalable) systems, have experience in AI/ML
- I've done four internships in the past, and am looking for a full time role now!

## Hi!

My name is Bill Zhang! As mentioned on my home page (and above), I am currently in a 1-year [Master's of Computer Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/professional-mcs) program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I also did my undergraduate degree at UIUC (in 3 years), studying [Statistics & CS](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/bs-statistics-computer-science), a single blended degree where I take the core classes from both Statistics and Computer Science.

Throughout my years of colleges, I gained experience in multiple disciplines of computing. Right now, I have the most experience in AI/ML, systems, and backend, but theres many other fields I want to explore. I am quite interested in anything scalable---especially if its for AI/ML. Another one of my interests is writing code for low-latency or big data applications, such as high frequency trading. I've recently been getting more interested in compiler work and code optimizations.

Although I'm super passionate about CS, I enjoy photography, playing badminton, biking, and urban exploration in my free time.
