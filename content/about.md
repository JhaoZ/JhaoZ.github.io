Hi! My name is Bill Zhang! As mentioned on my home page, I am currently a senior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) studying [Statistics & CS](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/bs-statistics-computer-science), a single blended degree where I take the core classes from both the Statistics sequence and the Computer Science sequence--still leaving left over time to take whatever electives I want in either field.

Throughout my years of colleges, I gained experience in multiple disciplines of computing. Right now, I have the most experience in AI/ML, systems, and backend, but theres many other fields I want to explore. I am quite interested in anything scalable--especially if its for AI/ML. Another one of my interests is writing code for low-latency or big data applications, such as high frequency trading. Currently, I'm still exploring what I *really* want to do.

Although I'm super passionate about CS, I enjoy photography, playing badminton, biking, and urban exploration in my free time.
