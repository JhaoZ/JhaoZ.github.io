## Hi!

My name is Bill Zhang! As mentioned on my home page (and above), I am currently in a 1-year [Master's of Computer Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/professional-mcs) program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I also did my undergraduate degree at UIUC (in 3 years), studying [Statistics & CS](https://catalog.illinois.edu/undergraduate/eng_las/statistics-computer-science-bslas/), a single blended degree where I take the core classes from both Statistics and Computer Science.

Throughout my years of colleges, I gained experience in multiple disciplines of computing. Right now, I am most interested in computer systems, especially distributed and scalable solutions. I find the challenges in building fault-tolerant optimized distributed systems interesting, and fun to tackle. Another one of my interests is in operating systems and computer architecture, and I enjoy learning about the various design choices each system has encountered. I also love learning about ways to optimize and speed up my code. I am experienced in AI/ML and Data Science as well, however I enjoy solving systems problems more.

Although I'm super passionate about CS, I enjoy photography, playing badminton, biking, bouldering, and urban exploration in my free time.
