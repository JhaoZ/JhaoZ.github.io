                &emsp; Hello! My name is Bill, and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Statistics & Computer Science, while pursuing minors in Linguistics and Mathematics.
                My primary interests in the vast field of Computer Science include Artificial Intelligence, Statistical Computing, Data Analysis, Software Engineering, Natural Language Processing, and Algorithm Design (especially if it's part of Competitive Coding).
                On the non-academic end, I love photography (currently using a Canon Rebel 100), I love to cook, I play badminton, and like to draw pixel art.
            </p>
