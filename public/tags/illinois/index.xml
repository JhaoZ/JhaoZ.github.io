      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a &#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://athul.github.io/archie/backdate&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  backdated&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; post, this post should&amp;rsquo;ve been published on March 17th, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the poor souls at UIUC that have nowhere to go during spring break, Chicago is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; top tier destination. Whether its because your home is 11,500 km away, or because you wanted to &amp;ldquo;lock in,&amp;rdquo; staying in Champaign for all 9 days of break is quite depressing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t think there is &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much to do in Chicago. You could definetly be entertained for a week, but I feel like you can knock out all the top attractions in a day. And thats exactly what I tried to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Photos from Middle Fork</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made this post originally to try out a gallery feature I was implementing for this website. Coincidentally, I started working on right after I came back from the &#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://athul.github.io/archie/https://www.champaignforests.org/forest-preserve/champaign-county/middle-fork-river&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  Middle Fork River Forest Preserve&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;. For some context, Middle Fork is a sectioned out zone in the middle of Illinois (it literally is surrounded on all 4 sides by farm land) that serves as a nature preserve. It also is Illinois&amp;rsquo; only international dark sky park as of 2025. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to come for a while to take pictures of the stars or milky way, but I never really found the time. Now, on the last few days of spring break, I decided it was worth a trip.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
