      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there! This is the first post on my personal website / blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I previously had a personal portfolio website, but I never liked the look of it and it was hard for me to update and add information because I  wrote the whole thing in pure HTML and CSS. 2 years later after I made the intial website, I decided I was going to remake it during spring break, and this is the result!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
