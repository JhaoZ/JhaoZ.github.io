          <p>I started this blog on March 22nd, 2025. A backdated post is essentially a post that I had in mind in an earlier time before I made the blog. However, I still want to post them on this site. To keep my posts in order, I want to have them be in the order that I published them&ndash;although this means that they are not going to be technically in chronological order in terms of actual time.</p>
<p>A common backdate post would be any image / gallery post I make. This is because I want to post my images here, especially ones I took before I started this website. Therefore, even if the published date of a backdated post is further ahead of some posts, the backdated post may be older than those posts, or even older than the blog.</p>
<p>I chose this method because it would be very confusing for my &ldquo;first blog post&rdquo; to be after a bunch of other posts.</p>
